## How Theme Toggle Works

- **Floating Toggle:**  
  A button at the top-right corner with an icon (üåô for light mode, ‚òÄÔ∏è for dark mode).
- **Implementation:**  
  - Clicking or pressing Enter/Space on the button toggles between themes.
  - CSS variables (`:root`) define all colors for both modes.
  - Dark mode uses `.dark-mode` class on `<body>`.
  - User preference is saved in `localStorage` for persistence.
  - If no preference is set, the calculator follows your system's color scheme.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Button is keyboard accessible (`tabindex="0"`, responds to Enter and Space).
